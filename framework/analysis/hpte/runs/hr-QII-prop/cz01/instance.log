The acceptable range for successful simulation of DX cooling coils in EnergyPlus is normally ~300 to ~450 cfm/ton. If the compliance simulation fails, check flow/cooling capacity inputs for consistency with the design. If simulation still fails, contact the CBECC support team for assistance. evaluating rule: Set CHECKSIM AirSys:SupFlowPerTon  (110:'HVACSecondary-Summary.rule' line 785)
