2020-03-18 18:08:35 - Warning:  AirSystem 'DOAS1' has a DX cooling coil and the rated supply flow per ton of (net) cooling capacity is 583 cfm/ton. The acceptable range for successful simulation of DX cooling coils in EnergyPlus is normally ~300 to ~450 cfm/ton. If the compliance simulation fails, check flow/cooling capacity inputs for consistency with the design. If simulation still fails, contact the CBECC support team for assistance. evaluating rule: Set CHECKSIM AirSys:SupFlowPerTon  (110:'HVACSecondary-Summary.rule' line 785)
2020-03-18 18:08:35 - Warning:  The AirSystem:Count for multi-zone system 'DOAS1' is not consistent with the maximum or minimum ThermalZone:Multiplier of the zones the system serves. This indicates the HVAC system serves more than 1 floor, or that Multipliers or system Count may be improperly defined. Check inputs for consistency. evaluating rule: Set CHECKCODE AirSys:Cnt  (68:'HVACSecondary-General.rule' line 1398)
