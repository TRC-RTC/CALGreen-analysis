# T24 2022 CASE Modeling

## Current File Organization: 

- `ModelKit Run` Folder contains files from Big Ladder needed to run modelkit
    - Add new templates in the `templates` folder [here](https://github.com/TRC-RTC/T24-2022-CASE-Modeling/tree/master/ModelKit%20Run/modelkit/templates). 
        
- `Prototypes` Folder contains current MidRise and HighRise prototype CBECC-Com files. 

- `Resources` Folder contains CBECC-Com Data Dictionary. 

- `Root Files` Folder
     - Since the [modelkit](https://github.com/TRC-RTC/T24-2022-CASE-Modeling/tree/master/ModelKit%20Run) folder needs to be run with a specific `root.pxt` file, keep files in here that may be used as a `root.pxt` file that will be interchanged in the future. 
     - Please name files according to prototype and not `root.pxt`.
