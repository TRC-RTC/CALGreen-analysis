# T24 2022 CASE Modeling

## Current File Organization: 

- `0 - ModelKit Run` Folder contains files from Big Ladder needed to run modelkit and should serve as storing point for templates across all measures. Please copy the contents of this folder to create a modelkit folder for parameters/root files specific to a measure.
    - Since each measure will have their own parameters and will want to separate out results, each measure will have a folder with their own developed modelkit folders, ie. `ModelKit Run - AllElectric` and `ModelKit Run - HPTE`
        
- `Prototypes` Folder contains current MidRise and HighRise prototype CBECC-Com files. 

- `Resources` Folder contains CBECC-Com Data Dictionary. 

- `Root Files` Folder
     - This folder will be omitted and replaced with the `root files` folder [here](https://github.com/TRC-RTC/T24-2022-CASE-Modeling/tree/master/0%20-%20ModelKit%20Template/modelkit/root%20files). Keep root files here from prototypes that are common across all measures.
